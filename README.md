# Grove

Grove is a grab-bag of extended components, examples, and utilities for developing programs with [Oak](https://www.github.com/oakmound/oak).

## Contributing

See contributing.md for specifics but pretty much all contributions are welcomed happily.

## Versioning

Grove's version numbers begin at v0.3.0 to mark compatibility with oak v3 -- the minor version of this repository should match the major version of oak going forward. Grove does not particularly care about breaking changes, being a grab bag of component libraries, and will likely stay 0.X.Y to indicate this. 

## Licensing

To illustrate what can be done in oak in a positive light this repository includes art for the examples.
