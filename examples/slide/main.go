	// or pygame, you'll have way more cpu cycles than you know how to
	// deal with, especially if you use concurrency well on machines with
	// multiple CPUs, which is going to be most of your audience.
	//
	// More importantly, Go is just as fast to develop with as those slower
	// languages but it scales so much better. A little effort into decoupling
	// your components with interfaces, and your code becomes far easier to read
	// and increment on.

	// But what I've said so far mostly applies to game jam style games--
	// how do you make a quick and dirty game in a few days without your
	// code falling all over itself. If you're interested in doing something
	// with heavy performance requirements, Go isn't the language to use.
	// Go's speed isn't good enough for AAA games because it doesn't have easy
	// access to things like OpenGL, Vulkan, or SIMD CPU instructions.
	// What Go can do with these things is call out to C to do the work for it,
	// but every C call in Go has overhead, and that overhead adds up if you're
	// calling out to it thousands of times per second.
	//
	// There's other practical issues if you want to develop in Go even if you
	// don't have high performance requirements-- depending on your platform
	// you may need to install audio dependencies, usb dependencies, and so on,
	// and for all of Go's benefits in cross compilation these dependencies
	// completely break the hope of your game working the same on multiple
	// platforms without you going in and testing it manually.

	// That brings us to our design philosophy in Oak.
	// First, if we have a non-Go dependency, we also have an issue to
	// replace that non-Go dependency ASAP. Right now we have just one.
	//
	// The motivation for having few dependencies isn't just so we can
	// feel confident that all of our platforms are supported, but also
	// making the engine easy to use. Most libraries in Go can be used
	// with 'go get', and we want the same thing here-- a developer
	// should be able to go get oak and immediately start working with it.
	//
	// After that, we want our API to be easy to use and small. Part of our
	// motivation to start building Oak was that other game engines at the
	// time took 500 lines to draw a cube or 400 lines to write Pong. Maybe
	// at their core, those problems do take that many lines, but a lot of that
	// code we can write for you (and also for us, so we don't have to keep
	// re-writing it).
	//
	// In line with this, we follow a rule where if we have to rewrite something
	// more than once for a game or for a package of the engine, that probably
	// means that should be its own package and feature the engine provides.
	// This does go against the go proverbs-- we do not follow the idea that
	// a little copying is better than a little dependency, so long as we
	// treat that dependency as part of the larger, engine dependency.

	// draw all entities.
	//
	// The combining of these elements into one loop causes
	// a major problem-- tying the rate at which entities update themselves
	// to the rate at which entities are drawn. This leads to inflexible
	// engines, and in large projects you'll have to do something to work around
	// this, or if you hard lock your draw rate modders will post funny videos
	// of your physics breaking when they try to fix your frame rate.

	// all fit into this single-function interface, but in games with a lot of
	// entities you'll end up with a lot of entities that don't need to do
	// anything on each frame.
	//
	// The engine needs to provide a way to handle game objects that don't
	// need to be updated as well as those that do, and separating these into
	// two groups explicitly makes the engine less extensible. Oak uses an
	// event handler for this instead, where each entity that wants to use
	// an update function binds that function to their entity id once.

	// So we were restricted because our tiles had too limited functionality.
	// In Jeremy the Clam I tried to adapt this out by giving tiles explicit
	// types based on their value, and each tile built itself using a Place
	// function. So where before we had a tile interface, now tiles are just
	// integers, making shared functionality a lot easier.

	// However, the immediate problem caused from this was that we no longer
	// could place multiple tiles in the same tile position. Before we could
	// stack floor tiles below wall tiles or doodad tiles, and now we need
	// tiles that are labeled as non-floors to place floors below them
	// when they get inserted during the start of the level.

	// We addressed this in A Fantastic Doctor by moving entity creation
	// out of levels themselves, but also by abstracting the concept of a
	// level in the first place. In this case, all a level (or in this
	// game, an Organ) needs to provide is a Place() function to initialize
	// all of its components when it is entered.
	//
	//
	// So while we didn't do this, that means that we can extend organ
	// functionality by making organs with layers of tiles instead of
	// just one 2d layer.
